)HW_LaTex_thesis_template
========================

Thesis LaTex template base on the submission guidelines of Heriot-Watt University 

Updated to support subfiles (for rendering each chapter independently of the full document) - a feature helpful for theses with lots of images, especially large ones. 

Other small tweaks are applied like using the acro package instead of glossaries for ease of use, and adjusting the hierachy of the structure.
