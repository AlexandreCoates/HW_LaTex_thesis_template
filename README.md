HW_LaTex_thesis_template
========================

Thesis LaTex template base on the submission guidelines of Heriot-Watt University 

Updated to support subfiles (for rendering each chapter independently of the full document) - a feature helpful for theses with lots of images, especially large ones. 

Other small tweaks are applied such as support for using acronyms in the document with the acro package, replacing the more cumbersome glossaries package. 

Additionally the university shield is now updated to something I cropped myself, rather than the previously included one which looked like it was traced lovingly in microsoft paint. 

Lastly, links to the university guidance are included, and text in each section describes the relevant portion of the guidance.
